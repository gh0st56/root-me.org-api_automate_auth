If you are using windows and you see this error â†“ don't panic it is a normal error, your program will flow normally.
"Warning (from warnings module):File "C:\Python37\lib\site-packages\urllib3\connectionpool.py", line1004 InsecureRequestWarning,InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings"
